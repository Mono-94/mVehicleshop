This code uses the esx_vehicleshop tables `vehicles`, `vehicle groups` and also uses another one to store the stores `mono_conce`




# Categories, you can create/edit/delete categories in the game!! 

I DO NOT RECOMMEND DELETING THE DEFAULTS WHICH ARE ON THE LIST, SINCE THE MAJORITY ARE NATIVE TO GTA, YOU CAN FILTER IN EACH STORE THE CATEGORIES THAT YOU DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE.

  These are the native categories = GetVehicleClass()

- sUVs
- coupes

- sports

- motorcycles
